# Sudoku-Solver-Using-BackTracking-Algorithm
This Python project is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. The program takes a partially filled Sudoku board as input and uses backtracking to find the solution.
The backtracking algorithm works by systematically trying each possible value for each empty cell. If a value leads to an invalid solution, it backtracks and tries a different value until a valid solution is found.
The program displays the solved Sudoku board once the solution is found. It demonstrates an efficient application of backtracking in solving complex puzzles and provides a clear example of algorithmic problem-solving in Python.

## Applications of BackTracking-Algorithm

### Robotics Path Planning: 
In robotics, backtracking can be used to plan the path for a robot to navigate through a complex environment while avoiding obstacles. (eg. Self Driving Car).

### Job Scheduling: 
In industries where machines need to be scheduled for different jobs to optimize production, backtracking can be used to find the best schedule that meets all constraints.

## To Run:
